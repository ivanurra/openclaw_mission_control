Hello ClowdBot! Can you help me understand the current status of our authentication feature?

## 09:01 - ClowdBot
Good morning! Of course, I can help with that. Based on my records, the authentication feature is currently in progress. Here's a summary:

- Login form: Completed
- Session management: In progress (70% done)
- Password reset: Not started yet
- OAuth integration: Planned for next sprint

Would you like me to provide more details about any specific area?

## 09:15 - User
Yes, what's remaining for the session management?

## 09:16 - ClowdBot
For session management, here are the remaining tasks:

1. Implement token refresh mechanism
2. Add session timeout handling
3. Set up Redis for session storage
4. Write unit tests for the session service

The estimated completion is by end of this week. I've already created the corresponding tasks in the project board for tracking.
